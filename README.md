ChaOS is an SMP-aware kernel that we are doing as a part of our studies at Epitech.

# Build Dependencies
* `make`
* `gcc` or `clang` (latest version, ideally)
* `grub-mkrescue` and `libisoburn` (usually packed with other binaries as `grub`)
* `mtools`
* `dialog`
* `qemu` (cpu emulator) *optional*

If you are using `apt-get` as your package manager (`Debian`, `Ubuntu` etc.), you can use this command to install all dependencies:
```bash
apt-get install qemu grub-pc-bin xorriso mtools
```

If you are using `pacman` as your package manager (`ArchLinux`, `Manjaro` etc.), you can use this command:
```bash
pacman -S dialog qemu grub libisoburn mtools
```

If you are using `portage` as your package manager (`Gentoo`), you can use this command instead:
```bash
emerge --ask sys-boot/libisoburn sys-fs/dosfstools sys-fs/mtools
```

If you are using an other package manager, well... Good luck! :p

# Building an iso

First, tune as you wish the kernel's configuration with
```bash
make config
```

Then, build the kernel:
```bash
make kernel
```

To build a complete iso with grub installed (suitable for USB flash drives or virtual machines), run
```bash
make iso
```

# Running with QEMU

If you want to run ChaOS through QEMU even if it's boring & useless right now, run
```bash
make run
```
